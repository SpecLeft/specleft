# SpecLeft Roadmap

## Current (v0.1.0 - Foundation)
- ✅ Spec-defined test decoration
- ✅ Step-by-step test tracing
- ✅ Skeleton test generation from JSON specs
- ✅ Basic HTML test reporting
- ✅ Pytest plugin integration

## Planned (v0.2.0 - Collections & Insights)
- 📊 **Test Collector** — Aggregate and correlate test results across multiple runs, environments, and branches. Track trends, identify flaky tests, and spot patterns in failures.
- 📈 **Enhanced Reporting** — Interactive dashboards with drill-down capabilities, failure analysis, and historical trends.
- 🎚️ **SpecLeft CLI Filters** — First-class test selection via `--specleft-tag/priority/feature/scenario` flags and pytest config defaults.

## Future (v0.3.0+)
- 🎯 **Test Plan Orchestration** — Manage, chain and orchestrate test execution based on dependencies, priorities, and conditional logic. Build dynamic test workflows.
- 🤖 **AI-Generated Tests** — Let SpecLeft generate test implementations from your feature specs using LLMs. Reduce boilerplate even further.
- 🔗 **CI/CD Integration** — Native integrations with GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, and other CI platforms for seamless reporting and result tracking.
- 🌐 **Distributed Test Execution** — Run tests across multiple machines and aggregate results in real-time.
- 🔌 **3rd Party Plugin for Syncing Features** - Sync feature specifications with external platforms like Jira and Azure DevOps to maintain alignment between requirements and automated tests.
- 🔔 **Notifications** - Get real-time updates on test execution and results via Slack, Microsoft Teams, Discord, and other messaging platforms.
